Most of its 1400-mile journey is a slow, steady, languid march to the coast. In a few unique spots however, gradient change and terrain can send it into a torrent of whitewater, releasing pure energy as the river tumbles over rocks and around bends. Glenwood canyon is one of these very special places.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.visitglenwood.com\/things-to-do\/rafting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1.

With canyon walls reaching heights of 1300\u2019 feet overhead the view is nothing short of spectacular. The canyon, which has historically provided the routes of railroads and highways through western Colorado, currently furnishes the routes of I -70 and the central corridor between Denver and Grand Junction. The canyon stretches from near Dotsero, where the Colorado receives the Eagle River, downstream in a west-southwest direction to just east of Glenwood Springs, on the mouth of the Roaring Fork. Wildlife sightings are common in the canyon, while elk, mule deer and bighorn sheep are common, you never know you might get lucky enough to spot an elusive black bear or mountain lion! If you raft in the later months of the season often the exceptional water clarity might allow for spotting rainbow and brown trout enjoying the calmer pools<\/p>\n<h2>3.
