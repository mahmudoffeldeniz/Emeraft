From awe-inspiring mountains to breathtaking rivers, we have so much to be thankful for on planet Earth and especially in our home state of Colorado. Everyone on Earth right now is not only connected by our planet, but also by this shattering pandemic. While we would never make light of this situation, we were excited to see some good news about our planet, especially today on Earth Day.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pollution Reduction: <\/strong>Since the widespread stay at home orders, our planet has been able to balance out some of the strain we have been putting on her for years. We have seen a reduction in air pollution, water pollution, sound and light pollution, and we have seen wildlife return to some of its natural habitats. While climate change might not be top of mind right now, we still wanted to make note of some small victories for Mother Earth and how we can act sustainably while enjoying our regularly scheduled life.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-37231 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landscape-1752433_1920.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1203\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sustainable Actions we can continue after the stay at home order:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home gardens<\/li>\n<li>Composting<\/li>\n<li>Recycling<\/li>\n<li>Handmade goods<\/li>\n<li>Home waste reduction practices<\/li>\n<li>Less driving and more <em>Zooming<\/em> (video conference) when possible<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Whether it is coronavirus or climate change: we are all in this together.\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are going to need nature more than ever when we begin to integrate back into &#8220;normal&#8221; life.
