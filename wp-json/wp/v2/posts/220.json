Browns Canyon is one of the most commercially rafted sections of whitewater in the United States. Summer activities in and around Browns Canyon National Monument include fly fishing, camping, rafting, hiking, four wheeling, mountain biking, and even ziplining. The Arkansas Valley truly has an activity for all. With so much to do and explore, it is no wonder why Browns Canyon is as popular as it is.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Every year tourists flock to the <a href=\"\/river-trips\/arkansas-river\/\">Arkansas River<\/a> to raft the infamous Browns Canyon. Browns Canyon is a 26 mile stretch of whitewater on the Arkansas River. With rolling class III rapids and lulls in between, this stretch is perfect for all levels of paddlers. Additionally, with put-ins and take-outs spread out amongst the riverside allow for paddlers to choose just how long they want to be on the river for. While many paddlers call this area home, it is also shared with the wildlife which inhabit the land as well. Abundant in bighorn sheep, golden eagles, elk, and peregrine falcons, the Arkansas Valley is truly a magical place.<\/p>\n<p>Come visit this newly named National Monument and see what all the hype is about!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Located in the heart of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, in the Arkansas Valley, Browns Canyon is known for its pristine mountain landscape and all the [&#8230;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-220","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v25.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Browns Canyon Became a National Monument<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Located in the heart of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, in the Arkansas Valley, Browns Canyon is known for its pristine mountain landscape and all the amazing recreational activities that come with the area.
