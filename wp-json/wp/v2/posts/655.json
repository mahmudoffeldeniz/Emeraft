There is nothing wrong with telling your family and friends that you are choosing to take this next adventure on your own. Here is a list of reasons to travel solo in 2017.<\/p>\n<p>The first reason to travel solo is because that it is just easier overall; you only have to worry about yourself. You can eat where you want, see what you want, and go where you want. Everyone has different schedules and times that they are available. Traveling by yourself will allow you to pick a day and a place and then just pack and go.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2994\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/07\/hike_pixabay-300x180.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"180\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The second reason to travel solo is that you will get some much needed alone time to reflect. If you\u2019re the type of person that is always connected, it is important to take some time away and just let your mind wander. If you\u2019re the type of traveler who doesn&#8217;t want to completely go off the grid the time spent driving alone is a great way to recharge your batteries. The silence might be strange at first, but it is something you will come to long for.<\/p>\n<p>Traveling solo will also be a big confidence booster. Everyone is nervous about taking off on their own and not having someone to fall back on. Ditch the safety net and learn to be self reliant. You will began to feel a great sense of accomplishment and, when you look back, you will remember that time you were in a foreign place with no idea what you were doing but somehow managed just fine and grew from this.<\/p>\n<p>The final reason to travel solo is that in the end you will feel more satisfied and will learn a lot about yourself. When you travel alone the stakes have just been lowered. You do not need to impress anyone else and only have to worry about keeping yourself happy, no worries about any drama. When you first take off the thought will cross your mind of &#8220;What do I do when I&#8217;m all by myself?&#8221; The answer is whatever you want. Learn about the history of the place you&#8217;re at, read a book, or just set up a tent in the woods and sit in silence. After a few days everything will become the new normal and you&#8217;ll ask yourself why you didn&#8217;t do this sooner.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more tips on traveling solo or finding that next <a href=\"\/activities\/\">adventure<\/a>, feel free to give us a call at <a href=\"\/\">AVA <\/a>and let us help you out!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It&#8217;s always nice to take a trip with friends, but sometimes it&#8217;s nice to just have a little more me time.
