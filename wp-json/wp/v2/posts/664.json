If you are a weekend warrior, you might as well the best weekend warrior you can be! Make sure you are all set for\u00a0lodging, food, transportation and parking. Most warriors already have a game plan for what they will do when they arrive, but for those that don\u2019t here are a few tips.<\/p>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-2943\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/06\/ennis_cabin_outside1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>Lodging<\/h2>\n<p>There are multiple ways to book lodging for just a weekend stay. One you become a well-versed weekend warrior, this part will be easy. Do some internet digging for Bed and Breakfasts\u00a0for a unique and relaxing stay, or heighten your adventure at a local campground.\u00a0You can also find great listings on sites like Airbnb, VRBO, Roomarama, Booking.com, and Onefinestay.

The best way to find the best food is to ask the locals. Mountain town residents have all the insider info &#8211; best happy hour deals, best hidden gems, where the crowds go and where to avoid.

To be the best weekend warrior you can be, carpool! Chances are you won&#8217;t need a car once you get to where you&#8217;re going. Most towns in the Rockies have a well-executed public transportation system. Looking to skip the car altogether? Check out mountain shuttle carriers, like <a href=\"http:\/\/mountainshuttle.com\">Peak 1 Express<\/a>, to take the stress out of your weekend.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is just the tip of the iceburg for becoming an elite Weekend Warrior.
