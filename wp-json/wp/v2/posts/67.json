We have some very exciting trips that are geared toward those who aren\u2019t comfortable in the water.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which Trips Are Best for Poor Swimmers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>People who don\u2019t swim well will still find plenty of Colorado rafting trips available to choose from. You can consider an <a href=\"\/river-trips\/colorado-river\/scenic-float-half-day\/\">Upper Colorado River float<\/a> or maybe an intermediate trip like <a href=\"\/river-trips\/arkansas-river\/browns-canyon-express\/\">Browns Canyon Express<\/a> or <a href=\"\/river-trips\/clear-creek\/beginner\/\">Clear Creek Gold Rush<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Check out our <a href=\"\/trip-difficulty\">white water rafting difficulty<\/a> levels page to find the trips that best match your ability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Safety Precautions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 166px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px 2px; float: left;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/IMG_0059.jpg\" alt=\"White Water Rafting\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Poor swimmers should also know that we take every precaution to ensure our rafters\u2019 safety. That starts with providing each person with a wet suit, helmet, and PFD. Before trip departure we give guests thorough instruction on potential situations that may occur and how to get out of danger quickly. Guests also have the chance to pose questions or raise concerns to their guides. This pre-trip routine will give confidence to any rafters who may be worried about falling out of the raft or not being able to swim adequately.<\/p>\n<p>At AVA Rafting &amp; Ziplining, we inspire maximum confidence in our guests by providing them with some of the most experienced guides in the industry. Colorado only requires river guides to complete 50 training hours, but our guide training process includes almost three times that amount. Our guides also have an average of eight years of experience, far above the industry average. They have seen it all and are more than capable of responding to the needs of good swimmers and poor swimmers out on the water.<\/p>\n<p>Check out our<a href=\"\/faqs\/safety-concerns\/\"> white water rafting safety<\/a> page to learn more about the precautions we take.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>An Adventure for All Swimming Abilities<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" style=\"width: 251px; height: 167px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px 2px; float: right;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/MG_5075.jpg\" alt=\"White Water Rafting\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hopefully we\u2019ve erased some of your concerns about not being able to swim well enough to go white water rafting.
