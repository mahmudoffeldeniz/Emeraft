It begins high in the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains, near Leadville, Colorado at an elevation of over 10,000 feet serving as the river&#8217;s cradle, where it gurgles as a small stream before gathering power as it descends.<\/p>\n<p>It ends where it joins the mighty Mississippi River, 40 miles northeast of Arkansas City, Arkansas. The confluence marks the end of the Arkansas&#8217; 1,469-mile journey, its waters seamlessly mingling with the Mississippi&#8217;s to contribute to the Gulf of Mexico.<\/p>\n<h2>The River&#8217;s Sections<\/h2>\n<p>The Arkansas River has<a href=\"https:\/\/encyclopediaofarkansas.net\/entries\/arkansas-river-2225\/\"> three very different sections<\/a> throughout its journey. The first section is its Colorado section, as it cuts through steep Rocky Mountain canyons, flowing 125 miles through the state. Its middle section cross Kansas and Oklahoma, gradually widening and slowing as it enters the Great Plains, with occasional bluffs and cottonwood forests. This much longer section encompasses 600 miles. As it moves through its last section in Arkansas, it covers about 900 miles and becomes a slow-moving, winding river through fertile agricultural land and cypress swamps.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Notable Colorado Areas on the Arkansas:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Royal Gorge:<\/strong> A breathtaking canyon with sheer granite walls towering over 1,000 feet, offering stunning views and thrilling whitewater rafting adventures.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-206441 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/diane-boots-sWY8QrP8250-unsplash-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"view of arkansas river from royal gorge bridge\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>Browns Canyon &amp; The Numbers:<\/strong> Renowned whitewater sections popular with rafters and kayakers for their exciting rapids and scenic beauty.

Brown trout are the dominant species, known for their spotted bodies and love of fast currents. With their vibrant fins and iridescent scales, rainbows offer a different kind of fight, preferring calmer stretches of water.AVA offers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/trips\/arkansas-valley-never-ever-full-day-fly-fishing\/\">full day<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/trips\/arkansas-valley-never-ever-half-day-fly-fishing\/\"> half day Never Ever Fly-Fishing<\/a> experiences on the Arkansas River. Experienced guides are ready to teach beginners the ins and outs of fly-fishing, including how to tie knots, cast, and read the river.<\/p>\n<p>Spring and fall offer ideal fishing conditions with moderate water temperatures and active hatches. Summer can be challenging due to high flows and hotter water, but early mornings and late evenings can be productive. Winter offers unique opportunities for targeting large browns in slower sections. The Arkansas River is also a haven for diverse wildlife, including otters, bald eagles, and bighorn sheep.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-205755 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/01\/IMG_0223-1-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"bear on side of river\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1654\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Climate Change and the River&#8217;s Decreased Flow<\/h2>\n<p>Water flow in the Arkansas River has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewatongarepublican.com\/news\/study-predicts-arkansas-river-flow-will-continue-diminish\">gradually diminished<\/a> as climate change takes its toll. Eastern Colorado and western Kansas experience arid climates with limited rainfall. To support agriculture, farmers rely heavily on irrigation, often drawing water from the Arkansas River. Over the past decades, the amount of water diverted for irrigation has risen significantly, exceeding the river&#8217;s natural recharge rate. Decreased flow threatens the river&#8217;s ecosystems, as well as communities and businesses that rely on the Arkansas River for tourism, recreation, and water supply.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-206443 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/nareeta-martin-SEsf7U_i0oA-unsplash-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"river flowing through farmland\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" \/>Luckily this the high snowpack in the High Rockies generally keep the water levels high for rafting. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.5280.com\/colorado-could-look-drastically-more-arid-less-green-in-100-years\/\">future of the Arkansas River<\/a> depends on finding a balance between agricultural needs, environmental sustainability, and the well-being of communities. This requires continued collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to responsible water management.<\/p>\n<h2>History of the Arkansas River<\/h2>\n<p>In 1819, the Adams-Onis Treaty made the Arkansas River a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/American_frontier\">part of the frontier<\/a> between the United States and Spanish Mexico until the annexation of Texas during the Mexican-American War in 1846.After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the United States and Spanish Mexico disagreed on the exact western boundary of the acquired territory.Spain claimed the land all the way to the Rocky Mountains, while the United States insisted on the Red River as the border.<\/p>\n<p>John Quincy Adams, then Secretary of State, and Luis de On\u00eds, the Spanish minister to the United States, engaged in lengthy negotiations. The Adams-Onis Treaty finally settled the dispute in 1819.The treaty established the Arkansas River as the border between the United States and Spanish Mexico from its source in the Rocky Mountains to where it meets the Red River.<\/p>\n<p>American settlers began moving into the Arkansas River Valley after the treaty, drawn by fertile land and opportunities for fur trapping and trade. The Arkansas River served as a vital trade route, connecting American settlements with Santa Fe, New Mexico, and beyond.<br \/>\n<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-206444 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/colin-lloyd-w7fQtF68WA4-unsplash-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"arkansas river next to train \" width=\"1703\" height=\"2560\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Mexican War of Independence (1821-1823) led to the creation of the independent Republic of Mexico, including the territory north of the Arkansas River. In 1846, the United States annexed Texas, incorporating the land south of the Arkansas River into its territory.<\/p>\n<p>The Adams-Onis Treaty&#8217;s boundary became obsolete, but the Arkansas River continued to play a vital role in the development of the West, serving as a transportation artery, a source of water and power, and a recreational haven.<\/p>\n<p>At Arkansas Valley Adventures, we offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coloradorafting.net\/finder\/\">a variety of trips<\/a> on and around the Arkansas River.
