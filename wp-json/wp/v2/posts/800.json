There always seems to be a new promotion or discount available depending on what\u2019s popular or what intrigues us. <a href=\"\/\">AVA Rafting<\/a> would like to take the time to inform our many amazing guests about a few changes we are making in order to offer everyone a deal that may fit their travel plans and adventures.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Raft in the Morning?<\/h2>\n<p>If you are not a morning person you may be asking yourself a few questions about why people would want to raft in the morning, and the answers may surprise you. In other climates, the general thinking is that it becomes warmer as the day goes on. This happens in Colorado too, with a twist. During the months of June, July, and August Colorado turns into an outdoor wonderland filled with wildflowers, meadows and natural growth as if the earth hadn\u2019t seen the sun for 6 months (which it doesn\u2019t because of snow fall, stay with me). What allows this to happen are the numerous afternoon thunderstorms that generally arrive during the afternoon hours on a daily basis. Because these storms generally come in the afternoon, the mornings can almost guarantee sunny skies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE EARLY BIRD DISCOUNT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now this is a good one. All someone has to do to take advantage of our Early Bird discount is to do exactly as the name suggests and take the early trip! I\u2019m sure everyone has heard the phrase \u2018the early bird gets the worm.\u2019 In this case, the early bird gets the best deal. In an effort to get more guest up and moving in the morning we have dropped the price on most of our morning trips along with offering added discounts for certain locations. So not only is it priced cheaper, but it may also be discounted more! The following trips now have a 15% discount that can be applied out of our Idaho Springs outpost:<\/p>\n<p>8:00am <a href=\"\/trips\/clear-creek-intermediate\">Upper Clear Creek<\/a><br \/>\n8:00am <a href=\"\/trips\/idaho-springs-zipline-half-day\">Cliffside Zipline<\/a><br \/>\n8:30am <a href=\"\/trips\/clear-creek-beginner\">Gold Rush<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In addition, we have lowered the prices of our morning half-day rafting trips out of our Granite and Kremmling locations. These are statistically the two most popular rafting locations in the state of Colorado because of the amazing scenery and atmosphere the rivers offer guests, not to mention the thrill of the rapids. Use promo code\u00a0<strong>EARLYBIRD17 <\/strong>when you book online, or mention this deal when you call.<\/p>\n<p><strong>BROWNS CANYON<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the most rafted sections in the United States due to its amazing scenery and range of whitewater adventures, Browns Canyon is a must see for visitors looking for a whitewater adventure. Our half-day excursions offer consistent Class III rapids through stunning red rock canyon formations, surrounded by 14,000 ft mountain peaks. We have now lowered the price of our 8:30am <a href=\"\/trips\/browns-canyon-half-day\">Browns Canyon \u00bd Day<\/a> by $10\/person! That means the price to raft in iconic Browns Canyon is now $64 for adults and $54 for children. This is too good to be true, and may not last long. No promo code needed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>UPPER COLORADO SCENIC FLOAT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let the name fool you; the Upper Colorado is no pleasure cruise. Even though the highest rapids on our half-day trips are only Class II, the Upper Colorado is still a thrilling adventure in yet another beautiful Colorado canyon. With a minimum age of 2 years and 30lbs, this is truly a trip for all ages and can now be enjoyed at, you got it, and Early Bird rate! The price for the 9:00am <a href=\"\/trips\/upper-colorado-scenic-float-half-day\">\u00bd Day Upper Colorado Float<\/a> is now $54 for adults and $27 for children. No promo code needed.\u00a0That cannot\u00a0be beat!<\/p>\n<h2>OTHER WAYS TO SAVE<\/h2>\n<p><strong>BUY ONE, GET ONE 50% OFF &#8211; HAPPY HOUR DISCOUNT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now that we sold you on the morning trips, let\u2019s look at the other end of the day. With the sun setting, on average, around 8:30pm, there is plenty of day left after morning activities to take part in an evening rafting trip or high mountain zipline tour. Here are a few trips to keep in mind if your schedule limits you to a late afternoon activity and offer a buy one, get one 50% off discount:<\/p>\n<p>5:30pm <a href=\"\/trips\/clear-creek-intermediate\">Upper Clear Creek<\/a><br \/>\n6pm <a href=\"\/trips\/idaho-springs-zipline-half-day\">Cliffside Zipline tours<\/a><br \/>\n6pm <a href=\"\/trips\/clear-creek-beginner\">Gold Rush Trips<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Use code\u00a0HAPPY17 when you book online, or mention this deal when you call.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE $5 RAFTING TRIP<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ok, one more deal that is sure to amaze, and if you read the title of this paragraph, you are still here.
