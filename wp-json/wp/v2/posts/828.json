city in 1878 when the resident count hit 15,000 people.\u00a0 Two years later, the\u00a0Leadville\u00a0and Rio Grande Railway made the\u00a0area\u00a0accessible\u00a0to everyone!\u00a0 Leadville quickly became a hub of tourist activity and shipped out high quality silver ore all over the\u00a0states.\u00a0 The stock of silver dropped significantly in 1893, and the town hit hard days.\u00a0 Over the next years the rising and falling stocks would bring people to and from the small city, but never for long.\u00a0World\u00a0War II brought in an influx of soldiers stationed near by, patronizing local businesses and giving the city\u00a0hope.\u00a0 That soon dried up as war ended and Leadville once again became a\u00a0ghost\u00a0town.<span

street&#8217;s as a door to the past.\u00a0 As a gateway to the Arkansas Valley, many people choose to stay in the area because of the lower cost of living as well as some of the local establishments that give Leadville the Colorado small mountain town feel.\u00a0 When driving through town, you can still see the effect the fall of mining boom days had on the city with empty building and abandoned
