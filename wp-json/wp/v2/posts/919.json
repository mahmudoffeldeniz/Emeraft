Below we will give you a few tips to help make your trip a success:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional help<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest problem you will have while arranging a business trip to Denver is there is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too much<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to do in the area. To help make plans, reservations, and to simplify the process, hire a professional event planner. Your hotel will probably have a recommendation. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan early <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are planning a trip to a major city, you need to make arrangements early. Depending on the time of year you travel, there could be limited space available. Here are some things to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many guests will be attending?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many hotel rooms will you be blocking and how will you guarantee them?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you providing all meals and transportation?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What equipment will you need for the actual meeting? <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Will you need space for vendor displays?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Meals<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may choose to cater your dinner and have it served in the hotel dining areas. Or, you may take your group to a restaurant. Be sure you overestimate (add 10%) to ensure you have enough food. Provide a second or third menu choice. While most dinners allow the guest to choose between steak and seafood or chicken, have a vegan, gluten-free option available. Be sure you collect the menu requests well before the night of the meal. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alcohol<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may choose to have beer and wine served or to have an open bar during your reception dinner. Some businesses opt for a \u201cdry\u201d event. If you select an open bar, limit your options and have a set time that the bar closes. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find Denver a perfect venue for your next business meeting.
